# ansible-art-network-pentesting

Ansible playbooks and vagrantfile to run the environment from 
  "The Art of Network Penetration Testing" (https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-network-penetration-testing)

## Usage
Ensure that vagrant and a VM provider (like Virtualbox) are installed. 
This has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 as hosts.  
It should probably work on other hosts.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive # ensure all submodules are checked out and updated

vagrant up        # bring up vm.  This will also do initial provision
vagrant provision # re run Ansible in VM
vagrant ssh       # ssh into the vm
```
